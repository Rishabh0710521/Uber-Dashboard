# Uber-Dashboard
This project aims to analyze Uber ride data to understand various aspects of ride usage, such as the distribution of rides across different categories, purposes, months, days, and times. The analysis is visualized using a dashboard to provide insights into ride patterns and help make data-driven decisions.
