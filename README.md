# Uber-Dashboard
This project aims to analyze Uber ride data to understand various aspects of ride usage, such as the distribution of rides across different categories, purposes, months, days, and times. The analysis is visualized using a dashboard to provide insights into ride patterns and help make data-driven decisions.

# Objective
The objective of an Uber dashboard project is typically:

* To analyze Uber ride data and uncover insights about ride patterns, usage frequency, travel distances, and purpose categories.

* To visualize these insights in an interactive dashboard, helping users or stakeholders make data-driven decisions about Uber operations or understand ride behaviors.

* To practice and demonstrate skills in data analysis, data visualization, and dashboard development using real-world datasets like Uber rides.

 ** Common techniques used when making an Uber dashboard project include:

* Data Collection & Cleaning: Importing Uber data (CSV/Excel), handling missing values, correcting data types, and filtering out irrelevant records.

* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Using Pandas/NumPy to explore patterns, calculate statistics (mean, sum, counts), and identify trends or outliers in the dataset.

* Feature Engineering: Creating new variables (e.g., ride time slots, day of week, ride category labels) to make the data more insightful for analysis.

* Data Visualization: Building interactive charts (bar, pie, line, heatmaps) with tools like Matplotlib, Seaborn, or Plotly to display ride distributions and trends.

* Dashboard Development: Integrating visualizations into a dashboard framework such as Streamlit, Dash, Tableau, or Power BI, allowing for interactivity and filtering.

* Insight Generation: Interpreting visualizations to find business/personal ride ratios, peak travel periods, high mileage days, and purpose analytics.

* Presentation & Documentation: Clearly documenting your code, process, and findings in README files, markdown cells, or dashboard annotations.
